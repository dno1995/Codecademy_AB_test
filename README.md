# Codecademy_AB_test

This is my look at the results of an AB test data. I ran a Chi-squared test to check for independence between
which ad was used and clicks. I found that there was a statistically significant difference between the two 
ads (with a p-value of < 0.0000), but that the relationship was fairly weak (phi coefficient of 0.0341).

It should also be noted that the two user groups for the two different ads actually have very different 
attributes. The user group for the first ad are long-time users of Codecademy, whereas the user group for
the second ad are very new users. Ultimately it is hard to recommend either of the ads from the data provided,
but I can recommend that in the future A/B test groups are purposefully randomized so that each user group is 
similiar statistically.
